# Timber

It is a real-time messaging app, with the possibility of creating various chats/groups with other users.

**Timber** is the app I am developing for my final project.

To get it running, first you need to create the backend's .env with the info provided in the .env.example. You will need a MySQL database set up.

Same with fronend. Fill .env with the data it needs.

Then, on the frontend, you need to use:

`npm install`

Then, open a terminal tab for backend and another one for frontend.

In the backend one, run:

`go run .`

and in the frontend one:

`npm run dev`

Open the direction the console says and if everything is configured correctly,
you'll be able to use the app.
